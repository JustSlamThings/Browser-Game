# NYU-SD-04 Milestone Project: Planning |  Browser-Game

Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

## Project Description

I am making Baccarat. I made it because I used to love going to play Baccarat at the casino. I think it is a fun game with better odds than Roulette or Black Jack especially playing by oneself against the house.

## Game Logic

Baccarat is a card game played at casinos. It is a comparing card game played between two hands, the "player" and the "banker".

Each baccarat coup (round of play) has three possible outcomes: "player" (player has the higher score), "banker"(banker side has the higher score), and "tie"(when the player and banker has equal scoring).
In baccarat chemin de fer and baccarat banque, by contrast, both players can make choices. The winning odds are in favour of the bank, with a house edge of at least 1 percent.

## Deliverables

"Tableau of drawing rules
If neither the player nor the banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards (known as a "natural"), the tableau is consulted, first for the player's rules, then the banker's.

Player's rule
If the player has an initial total of 5 or less, they draw a third card. If the player has an initial total of 6 or 7, they stand.
Banker's rule
If the player stood pat (i.e. has only two cards), the banker regards only their own hand and acts according to the same rule as the player, i.e. the banker draws a third card with hands 5 or less and stands with 6 or 7.
If the player drew a third card, the banker acts according to the following more complex rules:
If the banker total is 2 or less, they draw a third card regardless of what the player's third card is.
If the banker total is 3, they draw a third card unless the player's third card is an 8.
If the banker total is 4, they draw a third card if the player's third card is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
If the banker total is 5, they draw a third card if the player's third card is 4, 5, 6, or 7.
If the banker total is 6, they draw a third card if the player's third card is a 6 or 7.
If the banker total is 7, they stand."

### MVP Criteria

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard of having a player side vs Banker Side.
- Be able to decide if "player wins" "banker wins" or "ties"
- Amounts for the player to bet from $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $250.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- Dynamic ad libs or pictures to come out when gambler wins on the right side.
- Different user profiles that gamer can set up themselves so more than one person can play at a time.  
- Decorate the game so it looks better.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do...
